### What is this for?

> The role of the project is to manage the files you entrust to it for management.
> As long as you throw files at it, it can quickly classify files, so that you can quickly archive a large and complex number of files.
> 

### How to use this?

> we plan to compile it into a single-file program, which you can then place anywhere on your computer, and the program will use an absolute path to C://Program Files to store all the file information you give it to manage.
> 
> Considering the speed at which files can be opened, we also use an installable version of the provider, which is installed in an absolute path on your computer, that occupies an entire installation directory: this speeds up the startup of the program. When using it, you just need to create shortcuts where you feel right.

### What's the point of this?

> I really don't manage files on my computer, especially when I'm a UP master, and the problems caused by this habit are getting worse.
> 
> all kinds of recorded videos on my computer, downloaded music, documents that I don't know where to get them, are all over the place.
> 
> so I wrote this out, at least for people like me who are informal, maybe it will be a little helpful, right.
